1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:07,978
This is a video that i have been waiting to make for an entire year.

2
00:00:07,978 --> 00:00:08,830
(null)

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:15,061
Actually i hadn't really planned to quit smoking green for this long when i decided

4
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:15,203
to quit but.

5
00:00:15,203 --> 00:00:20,545
Now here we are so let's take you back on this journey to my relationship

6
00:00:20,545 --> 00:00:20,788
with the gunj why i quit.

7
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:21,877
And how it impacted my life since quitting it was sixth grade i was minding

8
00:00:21,877 --> 00:00:22,001
my business just taking a piss in the middle school bathroom praying that no upperclassmen

9
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:22,728
would barge through the door and start heckling me about something that my social anxiety

10
00:00:22,728 --> 00:00:23,568
couldn't handle my prayers were not answered and two eighth-graders that were in my sister's

11
00:00:23,568 --> 00:00:28,252
class came in as loud as any to eighth-grade dudes running into the bathroom could

12
00:00:28,252 --> 00:00:29,735
be i quickly noticed that they were my sister's friend's and put my head down

13
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:29,882
towards the urinal in the hopes that they wouldn't recognize me by my.

14
00:00:29,882 --> 00:00:32,834
Harry potter shaped glasses from my left ear i heard one of them say yo

15
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:33,170
isn't that olivia's little brother by this time i had finished going pee and i

16
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,220
had nowhere to run as it my pants.

17
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,381
E n t e r   i n t o   t h e m .

18
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:38,333
Yeah that's me after a series of questions that i don't really remember they asked

19
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:38,669
me do you think you'll ever drink alcohol and i said probably then they asked

20
00:00:38,669 --> 00:00:39,719
me do you think you'll ever smoke weed.

21
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:40,668
A n d   i   s a i d .

22
00:00:40,668 --> 00:00:43,161
Probably not boy was i wrong about my alcohol in bud intake fast forward to

23
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:43,445
the end of eighth grade and my friend do i plan to hang out with

24
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:45,108
already comes over to my house with a strange-looking black bag in that black bag.

25
00:00:45,108 --> 00:00:46,012
Was some green that he took from his dad's stash it was looking like it

26
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:46,115
was time for me to take my first hit ever i told my sister about

27
00:00:46,115 --> 00:00:46,719
what was in this black no smell back because she obviously had a lot more

28
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,417
experience than me and she quickly made a device made out of a gatorade bottle

29
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:51,307
i'm not going to say what that thing actually is in the hopes that you

30
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:52,540
guys can guess what she started my 6-year relationship with the sticky stuff by the

31
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:52,680
time freshman year of high school started i would do it pretty much every single

32
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,892
day i remember that you're specifically every friday night after ski club i would lock

33
00:00:53,892 --> 00:00:53,923
myself in my room.

34
00:00:53,923 --> 00:00:55,673
T h r o w   a   t o w e l   u n d e r   m y   d o o r .

35
00:00:55,673 --> 00:00:59,291
Do it out of my bedroom window and get under the covers to watch the

36
00:00:59,291 --> 00:00:59,703
latest workaholics episode it was definitely one of the stoner kids i was one of

37
00:00:59,703 --> 00:00:59,864
the.

38
00:00:59,864 --> 00:01:02,108
First kids in my class to do it frequently the green stuff became a part

39
00:01:02,108 --> 00:01:02,363
of my identity but when you start to rip green that much and you do

40
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:03,860
it that often you really don't realize how it's affecting your life that is not

41
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,436
until you decide to quit.

42
00:01:04,436 --> 00:01:08,864
B e f o r e   t h i s   3 6 5 - d a y .   i   h a d   n e v e r   w a n t e d   t o   q u i t .

43
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,913
I never made an effort to quit the longest that i had gone in the

44
00:01:09,913 --> 00:01:10,032
six years that i have been cheaping was 30 days when i decided to go

45
00:01:10,032 --> 00:01:10,731
sober for a month about 2 years ago but one year ago a lot in

46
00:01:10,731 --> 00:01:11,540
my life was changing i was doing a lot of different things to try and

47
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:16,049
improve my life in my life situation it was around the same time that i

48
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,477
pretty much stopped drinking alcohol completely and i started doing no fat in these first

49
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:17,640
couple months it was definitely hard to resist the temptation of wanting to do and

50
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:17,827
really out.

51
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:22,926
Everything sleeping was the biggest pain i had a much harder time actually falling asleep

52
00:01:22,926 --> 00:01:23,197
and then when i did fall asleep.

53
00:01:23,197 --> 00:01:24,386
T h e   d r e a m s   w e r e .

54
00:01:24,386 --> 00:01:27,591
Absolutely crazy i'm pretty sure that for some people if they smoke they can still

55
00:01:27,591 --> 00:01:27,956
dream but i never did and especially if i did it right before bed then

56
00:01:27,956 --> 00:01:28,669
i wouldn't even have like.

57
00:01:28,669 --> 00:01:35,679
Any memory of any dreams so when i was finally not smoking every night before

58
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:35,732
bed.

59
00:01:35,732 --> 00:01:36,821
The dreams were extremely vivid and so vivid to the point where sometimes the first

60
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:36,946
half of the day i'd be like messed up from the dream that i had

61
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:37,672
i'm not sure exactly when that one away i didn't really keep a log of

62
00:01:37,672 --> 00:01:38,512
all the things that were happening after i quit but i would say that those

63
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:43,196
really vivid dreams that would kind of messed me up a stopped after like a

64
00:01:43,196 --> 00:01:44,680
few weeks or so he'll let me tell you how this has impacted this entire

65
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:44,826
past year and why i think this has played such a huge role.

66
00:01:44,826 --> 00:01:48,815
I n   m y   s u c c e s s e s   y e a r   t h r o u g h   y o u t u b e   t h r o u g h   m y   b u s i n e s s   a n d   p r e t t y   m u c h .

67
00:01:48,815 --> 00:01:55,047
Every other facet of my life i want to preface this by saying i know

68
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:55,189
that green effect.

69
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:58,607
E v e r y b o d y   d i f f e r e n t l y   i ' m   j u s t   s h a r i n g   m y   p e r s o n a l   e x p e r i e n c e   s o .

70
00:01:58,607 --> 00:02:01,551
K e e p   t h a t   i n   m i n d   b e f o r e   y o u   d e c i d e   t o   g o   t o   t h e   c o m m e n t s   a n d   s a y .

71
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:02,971
Oh no bro i can smoke all day and i can get something done and

72
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:03,133
i'm happy and i'm productive and it was lacks as me and it makes me

73
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:04,080
happy okay man i first let's talk about energy levels the amount of consistent energy

74
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,175
that i have on a daily basis now is mindblowing to me compared to a

75
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:11,282
couple years ago so not like i was high all day everyday sometimes i would

76
00:02:11,282 --> 00:02:11,798
wake and bake yes.

77
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,116
B u t   m o s t   o f   t h e   t i m e .

78
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:16,068
I was smoking anywhere between 3 and 5 p.m. and after doing that it was

79
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:16,404
just harder to get stuff done i remember i used to try and work out

80
00:02:16,404 --> 00:02:17,454
while i was high to justify me smoking.

81
00:02:17,454 --> 00:02:20,960
And every time i would work out it just wasn't as good as a workout

82
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,359
now i can function with much higher energy levels throughout the day and with less

83
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:21,671
sleep to.

84
00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:22,815
Because i personally have felt like my sleep quality has improved and we all know

85
00:02:22,815 --> 00:02:22,946
sleep dictates every other area of your life when you're awake now i can see

86
00:02:22,946 --> 00:02:23,709
how coming off of it at first maybe the first few months or so who

87
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:24,592
would make you more tired than when you do it because you got sort of

88
00:02:24,592 --> 00:02:29,515
a mental dependency on it from just doing it every single day after you get

89
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:31,074
over that hump i think you experience what i experienced which was higher energy level

90
00:02:31,074 --> 00:02:31,169
another thing that happened when i quit that.

91
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:32,869
Was really hard for me to accept was that a kind of showed me who

92
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:33,062
my true friends were many times in the past i had this battle in my

93
00:02:33,062 --> 00:02:34,196
head of a my going to hang out with this person because i genuinely enjoy

94
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,507
hanging out with them and i want to go over to their house to you

95
00:02:35,507 --> 00:02:38,431
know have fun and do whatever.

96
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:39,700
O r   i s   i t   b e c a u s e .

97
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:46,711
That they're providing some sort of escape for me from what i actually need to

98
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:46,764
do.

99
00:02:46,764 --> 00:02:52,668
And that escape was the greek i still hang out with these people and i

100
00:02:52,668 --> 00:02:52,847
love them to death.

101
00:02:52,847 --> 00:02:58,456
But now i know that a lot of the times that i was doing this

102
00:02:58,456 --> 00:02:58,669
going over my friends house.

103
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:00,826
Just to smoke it made me kind of question if i wanted to see these

104
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:01,071
people really as much as i was seeing them related to that i think quitting

105
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:02,510
really helped me to cut out all the b******* in my life i think that

106
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,287
the gods really allowed me to bull.

107
00:03:03,287 --> 00:03:05,040
Myself in a lot of different areas of life and made me think in some

108
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,239
situations i you know i've done enough with my day i can take the rest

109
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:06,408
of the day off i can just chill and do nothing and i knew that

110
00:03:06,408 --> 00:03:07,760
i needed to do more if i wanted to really get to where i wanted

111
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,771
to be in life.

112
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:12,274
I   h a d   t o   p u t   i n   m o r e   w o r k   t h a n   i   w a s .

113
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:17,615
And quitting that just allowed me to stop both thing with myself it did not

114
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:17,859
make me more creative i feel.

115
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:21,158
Far more creative now and have more creative ideas now that i'm off of it

116
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:21,534
didn't really relax me like i told myself it did like i would have panic

117
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,120
attacks quite a bit.

118
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,325
When i was high i mean it was just like a total escape method for

119
00:03:25,325 --> 00:03:25,690
escaping what i actually needed to do and who i actually needed to be in

120
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,403
with that i feel that.

121
00:03:26,403 --> 00:03:30,271
Quitting has also allowed me to be more in tune with my real authentic self

122
00:03:30,271 --> 00:03:30,682
i'm just like a completely different person when i'm on it less emotions less.

123
00:03:30,682 --> 00:03:32,839
Passion for life less hunger to do things that i know will better me my

124
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:33,085
life no longer feels like someone else is living it after 3 to 5 p.m.

125
00:03:33,085 --> 00:03:34,524
when i would do it like waking and baking was so it's so stupid of

126
00:03:34,524 --> 00:03:35,301
me thinking about it now it's like.

127
00:03:35,301 --> 00:03:39,787
Wow you just started your day and you completely wasted it would look really performing

128
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:40,128
at a high level having to record write youtube scripts.

129
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:42,205
Coach people without content yeah let's see you do that and i would never ever

130
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:42,442
really do it that well so yes quitting it's made me have higher productivity i

131
00:03:42,442 --> 00:03:43,828
love what i do i love working for most of the day honestly that's really

132
00:03:43,828 --> 00:03:44,789
what my days consist of now but it doesn't.

133
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:45,971
F e e l   l i k e   w o r k .

134
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:49,087
And i know that i'm not going to ever try to escape my work around

135
00:03:49,087 --> 00:03:49,442
3 to 5 p.m. because i think i deserve it and then try to be

136
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:50,273
productive after it which i just.

137
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:53,389
Wasn't like i've done a lot of my edits and a lot of my videos

138
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:53,744
in the past while i was high and i just don't think they turned out

139
00:03:53,744 --> 00:03:54,575
as well like my god man.

140
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:56,912
Being sober is so underrated i never thought that i would be saying something like

141
00:03:56,912 --> 00:03:57,179
that something else that came with it was just being way more sociable i talk

142
00:03:57,179 --> 00:03:58,737
about this in a previous video about how at parties or social situations you know

143
00:03:58,737 --> 00:03:59,098
everybody's doing it.

144
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:05,696
They hand me that there like you want to take your head and i'm like

145
00:04:05,696 --> 00:04:05,796
yeah because.

146
00:04:05,796 --> 00:04:11,405
I want a more sociable and feel like i fit in and have something to

147
00:04:11,405 --> 00:04:11,618
relate with all these people.

148
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:16,292
But then you hit it and you become more socially awkward than you were before

149
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:16,611
hitting and you think it's going to help you.

150
00:04:16,611 --> 00:04:20,229
And it doesn't that's kind of what sums up my whole experience with green i

151
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,642
can tell you that smoking has kept me from a ton of opportunities because those

152
00:04:20,642 --> 00:04:20,803
opportunities.

153
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:27,813
Required me to get out in social situations and when i smoked you i got

154
00:04:27,813 --> 00:04:27,867
really.

155
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,929
C a n   i   t h e   p o i n t   w h e r e   w a s   t o u g h .

156
00:04:29,929 --> 00:04:33,796
Talking to people and so i declined many opportunities or situations where i would have

157
00:04:33,796 --> 00:04:34,208
to talk to people and now you know i'm much more extroverted i'm up.

158
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,947
More confident in myself i was way less confident when i was high on stanley

159
00:04:37,947 --> 00:04:38,373
thing about what is everyone thinking of me am i saying the wrong thing those.

160
00:04:38,373 --> 00:04:39,292
Things really were amplified when i was high i was still getting high everyday there

161
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:39,397
is zero chance i would be able to put out as many videos as i

162
00:04:39,397 --> 00:04:40,010
am now as i go to places like this and i get a lot of

163
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:40,720
b-roll and i just wouldn't feel up to it and also i'd get social anxiety

164
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,674
from the weed now i just don't have a problem talking to anybody so pretty

165
00:04:44,674 --> 00:04:45,927
much anybody in all of these things happened because quitting green vastly improved my mental

166
00:04:45,927 --> 00:04:46,069
health i'm no longer using weed to deal with my problems anymore or as an

167
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:47,301
escape or as an excuse for something or two bullet myself i deal with my

168
00:04:47,301 --> 00:04:47,317
problems naturally.

169
00:04:47,317 --> 00:04:50,268
And in a healthy way i don't use it as a coping mechanism anymore and

170
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:50,605
using the ganja as much as i was made me feel worse about myself over

171
00:04:50,605 --> 00:04:51,655
all i can think about this so clearly.

172
00:04:51,655 --> 00:04:53,898
Now that i've been off it for so long like the amount of negative thoughts

173
00:04:53,898 --> 00:04:54,154
that i had on a daily basis was doubled if not tripled compared to what

174
00:04:54,154 --> 00:04:55,650
it is now because i feel better about myself because i feel like my real

175
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,227
self and i feel fresh.

176
00:04:56,227 --> 00:04:58,097
And energized all the time and i'm not in that we'd stayed half of the

177
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:58,310
day then i can get what i need to get done always i can always

178
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,557
know that what i'm doing is my true self and i can do it with

179
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:00,999
a lot of energy look i'm sure that there's some sort of middle ground here.

180
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:02,994
F r o m   n o t   s m o k i n g   w e e d   a t   a l l .

182
00:05:04,936 --> 00:05:05,331


183
00:05:05,331 --> 00:05:08,630
I don't need it no part of me wants to do it anymore i have

184
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,006
no sort of itch to do it recently i had a buddy of mine just

185
00:05:09,006 --> 00:05:09,593
asked me straight up.

186
00:05:09,593 --> 00:05:10,827
Y o u   k n o w   w h y   d o n ' t   y o u   s m o k e .

187
00:05:10,827 --> 00:05:12,344
W e e d   a n y m o r e   a n d .

188
00:05:12,344 --> 00:05:14,681
If i could summon up in just one sentence this is what i told him

189
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:14,947
i said that i want to be able to perform at the highest level possible

190
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,506
in anything i do whether that's fitness weather that's in terms of business what i

191
00:05:16,506 --> 00:05:16,866
do right now.

192
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:18,861

Does absolutely nothing but hinder all of that i'm really not kidding with myself anymore

195
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:25,230
and i realize that it does nothing but hinder that.
